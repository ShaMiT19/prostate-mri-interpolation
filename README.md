## 📌 Overview

This project investigates deep learning approaches for MRI slice interpolation in prostate imaging. The objective is to reconstruct high-quality intermediate slices from sparsely sampled MRI volumes, improving volumetric continuity and anatomical detail.

Multiple model families were implemented, trained, and rigorously evaluated under a unified experimental pipeline:

- **CNN** (EDSR-style super-resolution)
- **CNN + U-Net hybrid**
- **Basic GAN**
- **Improved GAN with SE attention**
- **Diffusion-based model**

The project emphasizes reproducibility, structured experimentation, and quantitative evaluation.

**[📑 Main Report](./reports/ShamitSavant_DeepLearning_Main_Report_FinalProject.pdf)** | **[📋 Supplementary Materials](./reports/ShamitSavant_DeepLearning_Supplementary_Report_FinalProject.pdf)**

> **TL;DR:** U-Net achieved **30.08 dB PSNR** and **0.898 SSIM**. Key finding: **Problem formulation has 230× more impact than architecture choice.**

## 🎯 Problem Motivation

MRI scans often contain anisotropic resolution with large inter-slice gaps. Accurate interpolation of missing slices can:

- Improve 3D reconstruction quality
- Enhance downstream segmentation performance
- Reduce acquisition time
- Improve clinical visualization

This project evaluates modern deep learning methods to generate intermediate slices and compares their reconstruction fidelity.

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

Models were evaluated using:

- **PSNR** (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)
- **SSIM** (Structural Similarity Index)
- Error maps
- Side-by-side visual comparisons
- Radar plots and heatmaps

Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations were conducted across multiple experimental runs.

## ⚙️ Reproducibility

### 1️⃣ Environment Setup

```bash
conda env create -f prostate_final.yml
conda activate prostate_final
```

**Note** : Kept the yml files in "yml files" folder for cleaner repo structure.

### 2️⃣ Dataset

Place the dataset at:

```
/blue/username
```

Or update dataset paths inside `scripts/dataset.py`.

### 3️⃣ Training Example

**Local training:**
```bash
python scripts/train_cnn.py
```

**Note** : Make sure to include proper GPU access before running. 

**Or via SLURM (HiPerGator):**
```bash
sbatch train_cnn_slurm.sh
```
